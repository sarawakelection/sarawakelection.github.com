	   <h2>Sarawak Report's Federal Election Bribe Watch</h2>
	   
	   <p>This time we are operating a fully interactive map that you can add your information to!  So, if for example you have seen BN candidates handing money around longhouses or were in Beluru and disgusted at the sight of James Masing forcing land owners to parade before the cameras holding cheques for dividends, as if they were receiving 'gifts' from BN, then mark the incident down on the map (we already have this time) as an example of election bribery and corruption.  This way we can register BN's election crimes over the next few weeks.</p>
	
	   	<p>Rightfully, one day these crimes will catch up with their perpetrators.</p>
